/*
Taken from GAP Benchmark Suite
Class:  pvector
Author: Scott Beamer

Vector class with ability to not initialize or do initialize in parallel
 - std::vector (when resizing) will always initialize, and does it serially
 - When pvector is resized, new elements are uninitialized
 - Resizing is not thread-safe
